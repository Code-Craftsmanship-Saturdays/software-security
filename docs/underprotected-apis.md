# Underprotected Apis

> Modern applications often involve rich client applications and APIs, such as JavaScript in the browser and mobile apps, that connect to an API of some kind (SOAP/XML, REST/JSON, RPC, GWT, etc.). These APIs are often unprotected and contain numerous vulnerabilities.

| Consider anyone with the ability to send requests to your APIs. Client software is easily reversed and communications are easily intercepted, so obscurity is no defense for APIs. | Attackers can reverse engineer APIs by examining client code, or simply monitoring communications. Some API vulnerabilities can be automatically discovered, others only by experts. <td colspan="2">Modern web applications and APIs are increasingly composed of rich clients (browser, mobile, desktop) that connect to backend APIs (XML, JSON, RPC, GWT, custom). APIs (microservices, services, endpoints) can be vulnerable to the full range of attacks. Unfortunately, dynamic and sometimes even static tools donâ€™t work well on APIs, and they can be difficult to analyze manually, so these vulnerabilities are often undiscovered.</td> <td>The full range of negative outcomes is possible, including data theft, corruption, and destruction; unauthorized access to the entire application; and complete host takeover.</td><td>Consider the impact of an API attack on the business. Does the API access critical data or functions? Many APIs are mission critical, so also consider the impact of denial of service attacks.</td> |
